Group Collaboration: using MinGW
***for group members***

2.) Clone your fork (YOUR fork, not anybody else)
	2.1.) You can clone it by pressing the clone button, and copying link into your commandline
	2.2.) git clone <clone link>
3.) Add your changes, and use the above three steps to push it to your fork
4.) Go to the original repo (The one your forked) and press pull request
5.) You will compare across forks and try to merge the branches
6.) Wait for the git repo master to accept (or deny) your changes

Finally, everytime you want to use git, git pull before you do anything else.
